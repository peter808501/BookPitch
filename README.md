# Project Description:

Hi! Welcome to Book Pitch! The easy-to-use AI application who will generate a cover art, a title, and a synopsis for your new book based on one simple idea!
This project is powered by OpenAI's text-davinci-003 and DallE engine and will cost actual money to operate.

# Installtion:

Installation should be very easy. "npm install" should do the trick. The only two dependencies I am using is vite and openai. Try "npm install vite@latest" and "npm install openai"
if the previous command does not work.

# Usage

Very intuitive. Just type in an idea of a book and the AI will generate a cover art, a title, and a synopsis.

# Credits
